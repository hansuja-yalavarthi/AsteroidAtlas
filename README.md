# AsteroidAtlas: The Asteroid Awareness Platform

The **Asteroid Awareness Platform** is an interactive web application designed to track, assess, and visualize asteroid-related data. By leveraging machine learning, real-time data feeds, and APIs, the platform aims to raise awareness about asteroid threats and opportunities. Key features include a countdown to asteroid close approaches, a threat assessment tool, a collaborative forum, and an asteroid impact history map. This platform provides users with real-time asteroid data and educational resources to better understand the risks and possibilities surrounding asteroids.

## Features
- **Asteroid Countdown & Close Approaches**: Displays approaching asteroids in real time, with countdowns and key details such as size, velocity, and risk level.
- **Threat Assessment Tool**: Provides a risk analysis for potential asteroid collisions based on key information about the NEO such as date, velocity, size, and trajectory angle.
- **Real-Time Data Forum**: A space for users to collaborate, share insights, and discuss asteroid research, mining, and defense. Includes live updates from NASA and other space agencies.
- **Asteroid Impact History Map**: An interactive map showcasing historical asteroid impact locations, with data about event classification, mass of the object, impact date, recent data, and damage assessment.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: For predicting asteroid collision risks and trajectories.
- **Real-Time Data Feeds**: Using NASA APIs and datasets from Kaggle for up-to-date asteroid information, using SQL.
- **Web Development**: Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks for interactive elements such as Node.js.
- **Visualization**: 3D tools for collision risk visualization and historical impact analysis.
